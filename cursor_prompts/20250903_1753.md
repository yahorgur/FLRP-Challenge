Set up RSpec for this project.

Requirements:
- Add `gem "rspec"` to the `Gemfile` (if not already there).
- Run `bundle install`.
- Initialize RSpec (`rspec --init`) so we get `.rspec` and `spec/spec_helper.rb`.
- Create a `spec/` folder.
- Add a simple test file at `spec/smoke_spec.rb` that checks our `bin/run.rb` script.
  - For now, just test that running `bin/run.rb` prints "Hello, Fund Load Processor!".
- Verify that running `bundle exec rspec` passes successfully.
- always store them in cursor_prompts/ with filenames like YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md.
