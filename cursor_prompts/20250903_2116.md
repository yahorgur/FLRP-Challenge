Task: Implement a minimal runner that reads `input.txt`, builds loads, stores them in the repository, and writes `output.txt`. **No normalizers or rules run here.** No tests in this step. Also, save THIS prompt into `cursor_prompts/` (timestamped `.md`) as we track all prompts.

## Requirements

1) **bin/run.rb**
   - Make it executable and portable.
   - Reads from project-root `input.txt` (newline-delimited JSON).
   - For each line:
     - Skip empty lines.
     - Parse JSON with stdlib `JSON`.
     - Use our `Builders::FundLoadBuilder` to build a `Models::FundLoad`.
     - Add it to `Repositories::InMemoryFundLoadRepository`.
   - After reading all lines, write **project-root** `output.txt`:
     - For each record in the repo, output one JSON line in the submission format:
       {"id":"15337","customer_id":"999","accepted":false}
     - Assumption for this minimal runner: since we are not running any rules, set `"accepted": false` for all outputs. (This will be replaced by real adjudication later.)

   - Use `$LOAD_PATH` manipulation so `lib/` requires work regardless of CWD.

2) **Shebang & permissions**
   - Add shebang `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`.
   - Ensure `chmod +x bin/run.rb` is mentioned in README previously (no need to modify README now).

3) **Dependencies**
   - Use only stdlib: `json`, `date`.
   - Require our existing builder and repository:
     - `lib/builders/fund_load_builder.rb`
     - `lib/repositories/in_memory_fund_load_repository.rb`

## Implementation Notes

- The builder already accepts amounts with or without a trailing `$` (e.g., `"2000"` or `"2,000.00$"`).
- Keep the script simple; no error handling beyond skipping blank lines.
- Paths:
  ROOT = File.expand_path("..", __dir__)
  INPUT_PATH  = File.join(ROOT, "input.txt")
  OUTPUT_PATH = File.join(ROOT, "output.txt")

## Verification commands (manual)
chmod +x bin/run.rb
./bin/run.rb
cat output.txt

Input format reminder (each line is JSON):
{"id":"15337","customer_id":"999","amount":"1000","timestamp":"2025-09-03T10:00:00Z"}
{"id":"34781","customer_id":"343","amount":"2000","timestamp":"2025-09-03T10:00:00Z"}

Expected output for this step (since no rules yet; all accepted: false):
{"id":"15337","customer_id":"999","accepted":false}
{"id":"34781","customer_id":"343","accepted":false}
