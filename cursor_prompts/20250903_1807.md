Set up RuboCop and Overcommit for this project.

Requirements:
- Add `gem "rubocop", require: false` and `gem "overcommit", require: false` to the `Gemfile` under development/test group.
- Run `bundle install`.
- Create a `.rubocop.yml` config file with basic style rules (inherit from default, enable cops for Layout, Metrics, Style, Naming).
- Initialize Overcommit (`overcommit --install`).
- Configure Overcommit in `.overcommit.yml`:
  - Add a `PreCommit` hook for RuboCop that runs `bundle exec rubocop`.
  - Ensure RSpec tests run in a `PrePush` hook with `bundle exec rspec`.
- Verify hooks are installed and functional by running `overcommit --sign` and showing a sample `git commit` run.

Also, remember:
We are tracking all prompts in `cursor_prompts/` as separate `.md` files with timestamp filenames. Save this prompt there as well.
