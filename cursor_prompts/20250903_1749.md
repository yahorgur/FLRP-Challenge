Create a project skeleton for a simple Ruby script that will solve the Fund Load Restrictions Processing Challenge.  

Requirements:
- A `bin/run.rb` entrypoint that can be executed as a shell script (`chmod +x bin/run.rb`). For now, it should just print "Hello, Fund Load Processor!".
- A `Gemfile` with at least `source "https://rubygems.org"`
- A `.gitignore` that ignores `.DS_Store`, `*.log`, `tmp/`, `vendor/bundle`, and `.env`.
- A `README.md` with a placeholder project description.
- An empty `lib/` folder where we will put the core code later.
- Project should be structured in a clean, idiomatic Ruby style.
- always store them in cursor_prompts/ with filenames like YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md.

Please generate all the required files and initial content.
